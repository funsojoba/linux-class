#Assignment 1
# Create a Bash script that accepts directory paths as arguments. For each argument, list the contents of each directory with the name of each listed at the top.

# If you want to give yourself an added challenge, 
# have your script accept an additional argument, 
# “a” or “d,” that sorts the contents of each directory 
# in either ascending or descending order. 
# For even more of a challenge, 
# create a Bash script that sorts the 
# contents of the directories based on an “a” or “d” argument that directly precedes it. 
# In other words, you should be able to sort one directory in ascending order, 
# a second directory in descending order, and so on.

# Assignment 2
# Another way to work with text in Bash is with AWK commands. 
# For this challenge we’ll use the following data set of the world’s countries and their capitals.

# Create a Bash script that outputs this dataset into two columns: 
# one for the country and the other for its capital.

# For an added challenge, 
# have your script accept a letter as input. 
# The output should be just the countries that start with the input letter. 
# For another challenge, create another Bash script that outputs a 
# two-column list sorted alphabetically by capital city.

#Assignment 3
# Programmers who work in Bash are often System Administrators who manage computer and server networks. 
# So, it’s important to know which disks and file systems are mounted — 
# that is, accessible by the computer’s file system. 
# Note that just because a disk or 
# computer is physically attached with cables doesn’t always mean that it’s mounted and accessible.

# Come up with a Bash script that detects whether a given mount point or file system is mounted. 
# If so, the script should return the amount of used space on the file system and the amount of free space. 
# If the file system isn’t mounted, your script should return an error message.

# Looking for an extra challenge? 
# Add a prompt to your script that asks the user if they want to attempt to mount the file system if it’s unmounted. 
# When the file system mounts, the script should then output the amount of used space and free space in the file system.
